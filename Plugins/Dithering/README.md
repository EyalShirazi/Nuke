Even though Nuke have a dither node, I decided to play with dithering and build my own one.
It is still a bit buggy and a work in progress as I aim to add more types. 

The current node only dither one channel at a time, so if you wanna create a colorful one, you can give each channel of RGB a different type of dither.
