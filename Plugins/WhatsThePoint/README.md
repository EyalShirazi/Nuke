WhatsThePoint is a Nuke's plugin to get locators and points from 2d and 3d

This release has a Geometry module to get points from polygons (for Nuke 12).

One note... this is my oldest plugin I wrote for nuke, before this release I decided to rewrite it to make a bit cleaner and more efficient. 
Because of that I assume I introduced some new bugs. Please feel free to let me know on any error one may find.

Also this plugin works on Nuke "old" 3d system, so up until version 12. Futute me will try to adapt to the new 3d system.

If you want to installed the build version for nuke12, copy the file from build/nuke12 here and place it in your ".nuke" folder. 
The tool will not be visable inside of nuke. one way to call it is by pressing "X" and type "WhatsThePoint" and nuke will place a new node.
another way is to load it on nuke startup using init.py.
