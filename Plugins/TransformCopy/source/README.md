The tool was tested on windows 7, nuke 12.2v11. 
qt moc file was generated using qt 5.6.1

Todo:
  Fix issue while using viewer proxy, as the transformation needs to be scaled. It is already solved but will be added only in the next update.
  Reference number needs to be changed to the correct frame if using the retime. 
  Opengl is not showing the correct viewer widgets.
  There is an issue while chaining Transformation, if one of them is getting disabled, the rest of them don't get the Transformation up the stream.
